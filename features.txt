Grid Implementation ideas:

 - 2D integer array ... int sudoku[][]
	I guess the down side is it's primitive nature, not that easy to handle.
	Tedious searching.  

 - 2D ArrayList ... ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> sudoku
	Easy to check for values/possible solutions
	Not easy to handle

 - 2D array of our own object ... SudokuSquare[][] sudoku = new SudokuSquare[9][9];
	Where the SudokuSquare class contains an ArrayList of possible answers
	Or each square contains three ArrayLists, One for all the numbers in it's 
	column, one for the row, and one for the 3x3 square it lives in.
